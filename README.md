# Angular Tutorial - Build your first Angular app

## Conceptual preview of your first Angular app

The lessons in this tutorial create an Angular app that lists houses for rent and shows the details of individual houses. This app uses features that are common to many Angular apps.

## Development server

### Front End

Run `ng serve` for a front-end dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Back End

Run `json-server --watch db.json` for a JSON server. Navigate to the http://localhost:3000/locations and confirm that the response includes the data stored in db.json.
If you have any trouble with your configuration, you can find more details in the [Add HTTP communication to your app](https://angular.io/tutorial/first-app/first-app-lesson-14) page.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
